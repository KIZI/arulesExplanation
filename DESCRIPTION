Description: arulesExplanation provides a way to convert arules data structures to
    explanations which can be easily understood by non-experts. This means explaining all the rules
    in a classifier or simply getting a human-readable version of a rule that classified certain instance.
    Additionally, it provides several convenience functions for converting data structures
    between the qCBA and arules packages.
