Description: arulesExplanation provides a way to convert arules data structures to
    natural language explanations, which can be understood by non-experts. The package can explain all rules
    in a classifier, or only explain a rule that classified a certain instance.
    Additionally, arulesExplanation provides several convenience functions for converting data structures
    between the qCBA and arules packages.
